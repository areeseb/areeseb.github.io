# An Exploration of School Performance in Los Angeles County

This post showcases the work I have to exploring the spatial patterns in greenness, income, and race in relation to public school performance in Los Angeles County. 

**Background** 

It is well-established that there are major disparities in school performance in Los Angeles County (and beyond) along lines of race and income. This is often referred to as the "education gap." These disparities are frequently studied but often without discussion of the spatial dimensions of the problem. In this project, I investigate the spatial patterns of these disparities. In addition, I bring to light an additional relationship: school performance and the vegetative greenness of the area surrounding schools.

The brunt of the work on this project was completed in ArcGIS Pro with the data preprocessing completed in Python. I built a [storymap](https://arcg.is/1ueHrD) to showcase the work.

Note that this project was completed as part of my M.S. program at the University of Southern California. It is likely that in a few years they'll take down the data/layers I am hosting on their account. When this happens, the story map will no longer be visible and I'll make a new story or just share the paper I wrote.
