## Overview

This post is a landing page to showcase some of the more traditional (non-spatial) machine learning projects I worked on as part of my M.S. in Spatial Data Science.

To preserve academic integrity, I won't show any of the code or models without a specific request from someone unaffiliated with USC.

If you are interested in any of my work. Please [email](mailto:alexanderreesebrown@gmail.com) me with a specific project you'd like to see/discuss and the reason you'd like to see it. Generally, I won't share the repository unless we've had a prior discussion.

## Projects

**Non-parametric Classification for Biomedical Anomaly Detection**

Using parametric kNN classifiers on biomedical data. Exploring effects of different Ks, polling methods, and distance metrics.

**Factory Energy Output Prediction from Sensor Data**

Predicting factory energy output from sensor data. EDA, univariate, multivariate, and Knn regression, L1/L2 regularization, non-linear predictors, hypothesis testing.

**Time Series Classification of Human Movement Patterns**

Classification of human movement patterns from wearable biometric sensors. Time domain feature extraction, binary/multi-class logistic regression models, gaussian/multinomial naive bayes, model analysis (roc/auc, confusion matrix, visual separation), case controlled sampling.

**Interpretable Classification & Prediction Models for Sensitive Data**

Exploring various classification/prediction methods where interpretability is major concern (i.e. crime prediction, medical diagnoses). Tree based methods (hierarchical decision trees, random forests, L1 penalized gradient boosting tree, pruning), PCR regression, Lasso regression.

**Predicting & Classifying Air Truck Brake Failures**

Exploring various methods for treating class imbalance on truck air brake sensor data. Over/under sampling, iterative imputation for mising data, balanced random forest classification, XGBoost Classification.

**Multi-class/Multi-label Classification of Frog Species from Audio Signals**

Exploring multiclass/multilabel classification of frog species based on audio signals. Feature extraction, hamming/exact match loss, gaussian SVM kernels, clustering methods.

**Deep Learning Text Sentiment Analysis**

Text sentiment analysis (classification) using deep learning (MLPs, Convolutional Networks, LSTMs).
