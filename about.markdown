## Bio

I'm a multi-hyphenate Spatial Data Scientist/Engineer/GIS Specialist with a deep love of the science, the outdoors, and making the world a more equitable place. I graduated from Lewis and Clark College in Portand Oregon, studying Philosophy and Computer Science, with an empahsis on the philosophy of science and scientific computing. Over the summers, I channeled my love of the outdoors and working with people to become a AMGA cerified rock climbing guide. Realizing that I don't fully want to mix my hobbies with my work, I pivoted to become a formal school teacher through Teach for America (TFA) in Los Angeles. Upon completing TFA (during the pandemic), I went back to school for a M.S. in Spatial Data Science at University of Southern California (USC), figuing it give me a chance to return to my roots in the sciences.

After graduation, began working as a geospatial software engineer at an early stage startup that's focused on providing mapping and data management tools for public land managers. In this role I've been primarily tasked with building and designing backend systems to support large scale spatial data .
