## Bio

I'm a multi-hyphenate Spatial Data Scientist/Engineer/GIS Specialist with a deep love of the sciences, the outdoors, and making the world a more equitable place. I graduated from Lewis and Clark College in Portland Oregon, studying Philosophy and Computer Science, with an emphasis on the philosophy of science and scientific computing. I then spent a stint as an educator, first as an AMGA certified climbing guide, then later as a classroom teacher through Teach for America. After finishing my TFA commitment during the pandemic, I pivoted back to the sciences and completed a M.S. from University of Southern California in Spatial Data Science, figuring that the spatial sciences would give me the opportunity to dip my toes into many different fields (everything is spatial) and return to my roots in computer science.


Though I took courses in many different topics, including remote sensing, machine learning, database management, and GIS customization, my research primarily focused on studying social and environmental inequities through factors such as vegetation and air/noise pollution.


After graduation, I began working as a geospatial software engineer at an early-stage startup called [Outway](https://www.outway.io/), which is focused on providing mapping and data management tools for public land managers and stewards. In this role, I've been primarily building and designing backend systems to support large-scale spatial data for mapping. One notable project was setting up a production-level dynamic tile server to support near real-time visualization of large spatial tables. Another involved developing a novel heuristic algorithm for matching similar lines and polygons to support large data integrations.
